Reviewed documentaton:
 - Components
 - Referenced examples
 - Other implementation on GitHub

Check builds with two reference projects to determine breakage, assess complexity.
 - Load libraries
 - Fix and comment during builds, commenting accordingly
 - Determine if we an get a clean compile, and how much (extraction, replacement, resolution is required)
 - Too much breakage with full implementations

Approach is clear...  Find/develop I/O and I/O abstraction for platform and hardware.  Introduce higher level 
algorithmic code from reference code.


Input frequency from counter is divided by 8 - hmmmm...  Will this provide the necessary resolution for correction (**DO ERROR analysis**)

onnecte
- Merged code from several code bases to create a version that uses the MCP7425 and takes scaled VXCO output on either 
Pin8 to measure frequency, or Pin5 to count.  GPS 1PPS should be connected to Pin2

- Created I/O code to test Frequency Count/Measure.


Compile and run the sketches located in FreqCountTest or FreqMeasureTest.  

If they don't compile ("Header file not found" errors), 
add each of the zip libraries located 
using the procedure detailed here: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries.

Ran I/O Tests

- Debugged Circuit - 54HC193 was broke
- Verified input from frequency counter after resolving brokend device
- Verified I2C configuration to MCP4725 DAC - works at address 0x60
- Tested GPSDO code
     - Tested and fixed GPS 1PPS interrupt
     - Tested and fixed serial commanding

Works kind of

- Clean up, take break first. Also need to work on AD9850 code on arrival.
